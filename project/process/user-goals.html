    <h1>User Goals</h1>
    <p>1. How will your users understand the content of the project?
      <br> Via their own exploration</p>
    <p>2. How will your users understand the primary objectives?
      <br>The primary objective is to get the user to experiment, it is possible that they do not need to realize this is the objective in order to achieve it. In SoundMind, a successful experiment in any experiment that obtains a reaction from the virtual
      environment. Hopefully, the userâ€™s impact on the environment will be sufficient reward to provoke further exploration.</p>
    <p>3. What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?
      <br>Users need audio content, and they need an interface with with to interact and control the audio content and therefore the visual output.</p>
    <p>4. How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?
      <br>I assume the users will be expecting a much more linear and structured experience. The average user in our class or at the ISEA conference will have quite a fair amount of experience with digital interfaces. However, they may be new or somewhat
      new to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality interfaces.</p>

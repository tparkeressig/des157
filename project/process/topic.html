  <h1>ISEA Project Initial Topic Choice:</h1>
  <p>After reviewing my comparative research and original topic brainstorm, it seems appropriate to attempt to combine a music visualizer project with a VR landscape project. I am not certain how far I will get on this idea, but I will submit it to the art + landscape category. Perhaps it would also be useful for mental health and I could submit it to multiple categories.</p>

    <h1>Persona: Don</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Goals: Don wants to impress his friends at a party, so he installs a 3D music visualizer he found online on his laptop. Hopefully someone has a projector or a VR headset!</li>
      <li>Skills: Slightly higher than average computer skills for a 20-something living in 2017.</li>
      <li>Attitudes: Studious but fun-loving. Excited to try new tech.</li>
      <li>Environment: Chilling at home, chilling at class, chilling at a party.</li>
      <li>A few fictional personal details: Don doesnâ€™t have the most money to invest in new tech, so he tends to read about it online instead. He also likes free downloads.</li>
    </ul>

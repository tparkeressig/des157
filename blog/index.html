                <h2>One: "Evaluate a user interface"</h2>
                <time datetime="2017-01-19 01:00">January 19th, 2017</time>
                <p>I use Snapchat quite frequently to keep in touch with friends. However, I think its interface is pretty ridiculous, so that's why I'm writing about it.</p>
                <img src="images/blog1-1.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of snapchat" width="350" height="621" />
                <p>As you can see in this screenshot, Snapchat opens directly to the camera view. It has been widely lauded for this in interaction design and ux design circles. However, that seems to be where the intuitive features end. I have a firm belief that snapchat intends to make its product exclusive to teens by choosing interaction patterns that even college students have trouble figuring out.</p>
                <p>For the longest time, there was literally no indication of what else one could do from this screen. It's all icons. One must be willing to risk loosing a photo and simply tapping around to discover features, something my own risk-adverse parents have had the greatest trouble doing when I tried to get them to join.</p>
                <p> Thankfully, Snapchat seems to be taking some steps in a positive direction. While previously, one could not interact with the friend chatlist, seen below, by tapping on names. Only a swipe from left to right, difficult for a right-handed person holding their phone with one hand to do, especially when trying to read a message listed at the top.</p>

                <p>Well I can't hate it too much if I'm still using it, right? Thanks for listening to me rant about an app I use every-other day and love to hate. The end.</p>
